To address this, we introduce CONCORD (COntrastive learNing for Cross-dOmain Reconciliation and Discovery). The core innovation behind CONCORD is a probabilistic, dataset- and neighborhood-aware sampling strategy that dramatically improves performance of dimension reduction and data integration on single cell data compared to existing methods. Operated in a one-shot, fully unsupervised manner, CONCORD generates denoised cell embeddings that capture key topological and geometric features of the underlying biological manifold, revealing fine-grained local detail while preserving a coherent global structure. The resulting high-resolution atlas of cell states and trajectories is coherent across different datasets, such as experimental batches, technologies, and species. Moreover, these embeddings can be interpreted as context-dependent biological programs, facilitating the analysis of the regulatory mechanisms driving cell state transitions and subpopulation heterogeneity. We demonstrate the utility of CONCORD on a range of topological structures and biological contexts, underscoring its potential to yield new insights from both existing and future single-cell datasets.</p>"},{"location":"#installation","title":"Installation","text":""},{"location":"#1-clone-the-concord-repository-and-set-up-environment","title":"1.
